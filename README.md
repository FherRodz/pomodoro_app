# pomodoro_app

A new Flutter project.

![](images/1stSample.jpg)

## my first flutter app

This is the first app i decided to make using flutter. 
My aim is to make it a simple app to help the user keep track of the time while using the pomodoro technique.
In the pomodoro technique you choose a task that you will start working on for 25 uninterrumpted minutes;
and then take a 5 minute break. You repeat the process untill the task is completed or you decide you're done with the job session.

## credits

I did not create the pomodoro technique or its name. 
The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. 

The timer widget i use in the project i did not make.
